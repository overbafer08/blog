<p>Hi, my name is Abdullo, I'm student of MISIS, studying on first course. Here I will posts something for myself. Idk if this doesn't interest you. Good Luck.</p>
<p>But sometimes I don't do these, coz always lose motivation. Then use YouTube for seeking some motivation videos and I have found it. It was about Pavel Durov. He said about very important things in our life: </p>
<pre>
	Money isn't a happiness.
	Don't drink alcohol and smoke.
</pre>
	<p>But... Today I smoked nearly 2 ciggaretes. That was so bad. I smoked coz I miss my motherland, miss my family. But from this day I will change my routine. I will:</p>
<pre>
1 - READING BOOKS.
2 - Studying English.
3 - Programming.
4 - Praying to my Creator and He is Allah.
5 - Improve concentration.
</pre>
<p>I hope, if I will do all these action, In Sha Allah I will be successful! Everything is in the hands of Allah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">See you soon my dear old Me!</h3>
